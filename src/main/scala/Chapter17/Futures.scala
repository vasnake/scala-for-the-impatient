    // 1. Consider the expression

    //for (n1 <- Future { Thread.sleep(1000) ; 2 }
    //n2 <- Future { Thread.sleep(1000); 40 })
    //println(n1 + n2)
    //How is the expression translated to map and flatMap calls? Are the two futures executed
    //concurrently or one after the other? In which thread does the call to println occur?
    def ex1 = {
        ???
    }

    // 2. Write a function doInOrder that, given two functions f: T => Future[U] and g: U
    //=> Future[V], produces a function T => Future[U] that, for a given t, eventually
    //yields g(f(t)).
    def ex2 = {
        ???
    }

    // 3. Repeat the preceding exercise for any sequence of functions of type T => Future[T].
    def ex3 = {
        ???
    }

    // 4. Write a function doTogether that, given two functions f: T => Future[U] and g: U
    //=> Future[V], produces a function T => Future[(U, V)], running the two
    //computations in parallel and, for a given t, eventually yielding (f(t), g(t)).
    def ex4 = {
        ???
    }

    // 5. Write a function that receives a sequence of futures and returns a future that eventually yields a
    //sequence of all results.
    def ex5 = {
        ???
    }

    // 6. Write a method
    //Click here to view code image
    //Future[T] repeat(action: => T, until: T => Boolean)
    //that asynchronously repeats the action until it produces a value that is accepted by the until
    //predicate, which should also run asynchronously. Test with a function that reads a password
    //from the console, and a function that simulates a validity check by sleeping for a second and
    //then checking that the password is "secret". Hint: Use recursion.
    def ex6 = {
        ???
    }

    // 7. Write a program that counts the prime numbers between 1 and n, as reported by
    //BigInt.isProbablePrime. Divide the interval into p parts, where p is the number of
    //available processors. Count the primes in each part in concurrent futures and combine the
    //results.
    def ex7 = {
        ???
    }

    // 8. Write a program that asks the user for a URL, reads the web page at that URL, and displays all
    //the hyperlinks. Use a separate Future for each of these three steps.
    def ex8 = {
        ???
    }

    // 9. Write a program that asks the user for a URL, reads the web page at that URL, finds all the
    //hyperlinks, visits each of them concurrently, and locates the Server HTTP header for each of
    //them. Finally, print a table of which servers were found how often. The futures that visit each
    //page should return the header.
    def ex9 = {
        ???
    }

    // 10. Change the preceding exercise where the futures that visit each header update a shared Java
    //ConcurrentHashMap or Scala TrieMap. This isnâ€™t as easy as it sounds. A threadsafe data
    //structure is safe in the sense that you cannot corrupt its implementation, but you have to make
    //sure that sequences of reads and updates are atomic.
    def ex10 = {
        ???
    }

    // 11. Using futures, run four tasks that each sleep for ten seconds and then print the current time. If
    //you have a reasonably modern computer, it is very likely that it reports four available
    //processors to the JVM, and the futures should all complete at around the same time. Now repeat
    //with forty tasks. What happens? Why? Replace the execution context with a cached thread pool.
    //What happens now? (Be careful to define the futures after replacing the implicit execution
    //context.)
    def ex11 = {
        ???
    }

    // 12. Write a method that, given a URL, locates all hyperlinks, makes a promise for each of them,
    //starts a task in which it will eventually fulfill all promises, and returns a sequence of futures for
    //the promises. Why would it not be a good idea to return a sequence of promises?
    def ex12 = {
        ???
    }

    // 13. Use a promise for implementing cancellation. Given a range of big integers, split the range into
    //subranges that you concurrently search for palindromic primes. When such a prime is found, set
    //it as the value of the future. All tasks should periodically check whether the promise is
    //completed, in which case they should terminate.
    def ex13 = {
        ???
    }
